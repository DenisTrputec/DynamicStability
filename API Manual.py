int SID - Defines the bus subsystem to be used (input; -1 by default).
            SID = a negative value, to instruct the API to assume a subsystem containing all buses in the working case.
            SID = a valid bus subsystem identifier. Valid subsystem identifiers range from 0 to 11. Subsystem SID must
                    have been previously defined.
int FLAG - Is a flag indicating which subsystem machines to include (input; 1 by default).
            FLAG = 1 for only in-service machines at in-service plants (type code 2 or 3).
            FLAG = 2 for all machines at in-service plants (type code 2 or 3).
            FLAG = 3 for only in-service machines, including those at Type 1 and 4 buses.
            FLAG = 4 for all machines.
char[[]] STRING - Is an array of NSTR elements specifying NSTR of the following strings indicating the bus and/or 
                    machine quantities desired (input; no default allowed):
                        ‚ÄôNUMBER‚Äô Bus number.
                        ‚ÄôSTATUS‚Äô Machine status.
                        ‚ÄôWMOD‚Äô Wind machine reactive power limits mode; 0 if the machine is not a wind machine.
                        ‚ÄôOWNERS‚Äô Number of owners.
                        ‚ÄôOWN1‚Äô First owner.
                        ‚ÄôOWN2‚Äô Second owner.
                        ‚ÄôOWN3‚Äô Third owner.
                        ‚ÄôOWN4‚Äô Fourth owner.
                        ‚ÄôCZG‚Äô Grounding impedance data input/output (I/O) code (1 for per unit, 2 for ohms).
int IERR - Is the error code (output).
            IERR = 0 No error.
            IERR = 1 Working case is empty.
            IERR = 2 Invalid SID value.
            IERR = 3 Invalid FLAG value.
            IERR = 4 Invalid NSTR value.
            IERR = 5 DIM, and hence the size of IARRAY, is not large enough.
            IERR = 6 Invalid STRING value.
            IERR = 7 Sequence data not in case (when STRING = ‚ÄôCZG‚Äô).
